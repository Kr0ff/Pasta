# Overview
Pasta is a python 3 tool which performs PasteBin scraping without the use of PasteBin's scraping API. This makes Pasta free and doesn't require an acccount making it suitable for everyone.

It is not as powerful as the PastaBin scraping API but should suffice with providing enough information to look for usernames, passwords, emails, IP addresses and maybe more.
